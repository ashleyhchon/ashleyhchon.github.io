        <h2>Non-Trivial Pursuit</h2>
        <h5>MATLAB  |  Feb - Mar 2020</h5>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Pursuit problems are ubiquitous in engineering, mathematics, and computer science. The &#x27;Homicidal Chauffeur Problem&#x27; is a famous example. For a more humane example from biology, you could watch this famous movie of a white blood-cell chasing a bacterium. In the classic pursuit problem, a fast, but poorly maneuverable hunter chases a slower, but highly maneuverable prey. The hunter and prey both seek optimal strategies to catch, or to escape, their competitor.</p>
        <p>In this design project I worked on a <strong>computerized version of a pursuit problem</strong> that represents, approximately, a large drone in pursuit of a smaller one. The predator chose the magnitude and direction of its propulsive force to try to catch the prey; while the prey tried to escape. Both competitors have a finite energy reserve, but can refuel by landing. A hard landing will cause the vehicle to crash.</p>
        <p>The goal of the design project was to write <strong>MATLAB</strong> scripts that determine the forces that must act on the predator and the prey to achieve their objectives. My partner and I wrote codes for both predator and prey. Our codes were tested against those of a competing group. The winning team was chosen based on a combination of how long the prey can escape the competing predator, together with how quickly the predator can catch the prey designed by the competing team. During the tests, our prey and predator were both victorious. </p>

        <h3>Pursuit Strategy</h3>
        <p>Our final pursuit strategy consisted of code that computed the force applied to the predator with the addition of refuel code that activates if the energy is at or below 35%. The direction of the force was set as a combination of the difference in position and velocity. The difference in position, denoted as r_diff, was calculated by subtracting the predator’s position vector from the prey’s position vector. The difference in velocity, denoted as v_diff, was calculated by subtracting the predator’s velocity vector from the prey’s velocity vector. The difference in position had lots of weight in determining the direction of the force as the predator had to close any gap between it and the prey. The difference in velocity was also factored in to push the predator more towards where the prey was going to be at future times. </p>
        <p>As the position difference decreases, the influence of the velocity difference decreases. This was implemented because once the predator is close enough to the prey, we believed it should have focused as much of its energy as possible to simply get from its position to the prey’s. This was done by multiplying v_diff by a manipulation of the equation 1/(1+exp(-r_diff)), a function that approaches 0 as r_diff goes to -∞ and approaches 1 as r_diff goes to ∞. A 3 was added to the exponent term to translate the function to the right so that it approached 0 as r_diff approached 0 and increased to 1 as r_diff increased. The numerator was then changed to an 8 so that the function provided greater outputs. Thus, when r_diff was small, v_diff was multiplied by a smaller number and when r_diff was large, v_diff was multiplied by a larger number. (Note: the numbers 3 and 8 came through systematic manipulations of the equation to find the optimal conditions for our purposes, i.e. we used trial and error)</p>
        <p>Then, the direction vector was normalized and the force was set as the maximum force in that direction. We then added a vector &lt;0; mr*g&gt; to account for gravity, and relied on the provided code to bring the total magnitude of the force to the given maximum. However, if the predator was below a y-position of 100, the vector &lt;0; Frmax&gt; was added instead to ensure a greater force in the y-direction and prevent a crashing situation. </p>
        <p>Other parts of the predator code included the refuel code, a crash avoidance code that pointed the maximum force directly upwards under a certain y-position threshold, and a “startup” code that propelled the predator upward if the time elapsed was less than 3 seconds. </p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3>Escape Strategy<br></h3>
        <p>Our final escape strategy consisted of code that computed the force applied to the prey with the addition of refuel code that activates if the energy is at or below 30%. The overall strategy was that the prey would constantly be perpendicular to the motion of the predator by setting the direction of the force as a negative reciprocal of the predator velocity vector. We then multiplied this direction vector by Fymax and relied on the given code to bring the magnitude of the force to the given maximum. Addition of another vector to account for gravity was deemed unnecessary. Therefore, the prey was not technically moving at a true perpendicular direction from the predator. </p>
        <p>Other parts of the escape code included the refuel code, a crash avoidance code that worked in essentially the same way as the predator’s crash avoidance code, and a “startup” code that was also the same as the predator’s “startup” code. </p>
